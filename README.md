# Grace Okoro 👋

**`Health Informatics (MS) • Wearable & Digital Health Analytics • Data & ML • Health Data Privacy`**

My career path has been intentionally interdisciplinary. While my experiences may appear nonlinear, they have shaped me into an adaptable problem-solver, strong communicator, and systems-level thinker with a deep interest in how technology can be used to improve health outcomes.

I began my professional journey as a **group fitness instructor**, where I used interactive fitness technologies such as **Spivi** to help participants set goals, track performance, and understand their progress in real time. What started as a physical challenge quickly became my first exposure to **IoT as an educational and motivational tool**, allowing me to mobilize diverse groups of people toward shared health goals.

I later built on this foundation through my work at a **neuroscience-focused nonprofit**, where I supported neuroscience education programs that leveraged **augmented reality and digital simulations** to teach audiences about brain health. In parallel, I reviewed neuroscience research and engaged directly with researchers, gaining exposure to methodologies that frequently incorporated **generative AI and brain–machine interfaces**.

Although these experiences differ in form, they share a common core: **using technology to create favorable health outcomes**. Together, they inform my work in health informatics and motivate my interest in **consulting**, where I aim to translate complex technologies, data, and research into accessible, human-centered solutions.

This GitHub serves as a central landing page for my **health analytics, machine learning, and informatics projects**, with a focus on clarity, reproducibility, and real-world relevance.

## 👩🏾‍💻 Current Focus Areas

### 📊 Wearable Data Analytics & Machine Learning
I develop analytics and ML pipelines using wearable-style datasets (e.g., Fitbit activity and sleep data) to:
- Predict **sleep duration** and **sleep quality**
- Identify behavioral drivers through correlations and feature importance
- Translate quantitative results into meaningful health insights

These projects reflect my interest in **digital biomarkers**, **behavioral health**, and **data-informed decision-making**.

---

### 🔐 Health Data Privacy & Cybersecurity (Consumer Technologies)
I analyze privacy, security, and governance challenges in **consumer health and wearable ecosystems**, with attention to:
- The boundary between consumer and clinical health data  
- Ethical and regulatory gaps in wearable data use  
- Practical mitigation strategies grounded in health informatics principles  

---

### 🧠 Neuroscience Education & Research Exposure
Through my work at a neuroscience nonprofit, I supported:
- Education initiatives using AR and digital simulations  
- Review of neuroscience research methodologies  
- Direct engagement with researchers on emerging technologies  

This experience informs my approach to responsible, evidence-based health technology.

## 🏋🏾‍♀️ Perspective from Group Fitness & Health Behavior
My background as a group fitness instructor strongly shapes how I approach digital health and analytics. Teaching fitness classes required me to:
- Motivate behavior change  
- Communicate goals and progress clearly  
- Use technology to engage diverse populations  

This perspective helps me evaluate health technologies not only for technical performance, but also for **usability, engagement, and real-world impact**.
