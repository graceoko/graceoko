# Grace U. Okoro 👋  
**Health Informatics (MS)** • **Wearable & Digital Health Analytics** • **Data Science & Machine Learning** • **Health Data Privacy**

I’m a Health Informatics master’s student at the University of Pittsburgh with a background spanning group fitness instruction, neuroscience research and education, and health data analytics. My work sits at the intersection of wearable technology, machine learning, health behavior, and data governance, with a strong focus on translating complex data into practical, human-centered insights, particularly in the context of sleep, stroke, and cardiovascular health.

This GitHub serves as a landing page for my analytics projects, machine learning work using wearable data, and health technology analyses, with an emphasis on clarity, reproducibility, and real-world application.

## 👩🏾‍💻 What I’m Working On

### 📊 Wearable Data & Machine Learning
I build end-to-end analytics and machine learning pipelines using wearable-style datasets (e.g., Fitbit-like activity and sleep data) to:

- Predict sleep duration and sleep quality  
- Explore behavioral drivers using correlations and feature importance  
- Translate model outputs into actionable health insights

This work includes supervised learning approaches (regression and tree-based classification models), evaluated using cross-validation and standard performance metrics.

**Skills demonstrated:** data cleaning, feature engineering, regression and classification models, model evaluation, and interpretation.

### 🔐 Health Data Privacy & Cybersecurity (Consumer Tech)
I analyze privacy, security, and governance challenges in consumer health and wearable ecosystems, focusing on:

- Risks at the boundary of clinical vs. consumer health data  
- Ethical and regulatory gaps in wearable data use  
- Practical mitigation strategies grounded in informatics principles  

➡️ *Written analyses and policy-focused repositories*

### 🧠 Neuroscience Research & Education
I previously worked at a neuroscience-focused nonprofit, supporting research funding, education initiatives, and scientific advisory processes. This experience informs how I approach:

- Evidence-based health technology  
- Clear communication of complex scientific concepts  
- Responsible use of data in sensitive domains  

---

### 🏋🏾‍♀️ Background in Group Fitness & Health Behavior
Before and alongside my technical work, I was a group fitness instructor, which strongly shapes my approach to digital health. This gave me hands-on experience with:

- Behavior change and motivation  
- Wearable and fitness technologies in real-world settings  
- Communicating data and goals to diverse populations  

This perspective helps me design and evaluate health technologies that are usable, engaging, and grounded in human behavior.
