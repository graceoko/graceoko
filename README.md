# Grace Okoro 👋

**`Health Informatics (MS) • Wearable & Digital Health Analytics • Data & ML • Health Data Privacy`**

I’m a Health Informatics master’s student at the University of Pittsburgh with a background spanning **group fitness instruction**, **neuroscience research and education**, and **health data analytics**. My work sits at the intersection of **wearable technology**, **machine learning**, **health behavior**, and **data governance**, with a strong focus on translating complex data into practical, human-centered insights.

This GitHub serves as a landing page for my **analytics projects**, **machine learning work using wearable data**, and **health technology analyses**, with an emphasis on clarity, reproducibility, and real-world application.

## 👩🏾‍💻 What I’m Working On

### 📊 Wearable Data & Machine Learning
I build end-to-end ML and analytics pipelines using wearable-style datasets (e.g., Fitbit-like activity and sleep data) to:
- Predict **sleep duration** and **sleep quality**
- Explore behavioral drivers using correlations and feature importance
- Translate model results into actionable health insights

**Skills demonstrated:** data cleaning, feature engineering, regression & classification models, model evaluation, interpretation.

➡️ *Repos linked below*

---

### 🔐 Health Data Privacy & Cybersecurity (Consumer Tech)
I analyze privacy, security, and governance challenges in **consumer health and wearable ecosystems**, focusing on:
- Risks at the boundary of clinical vs. consumer health data  
- Ethical and regulatory gaps in wearable data use  
- Practical mitigation strategies grounded in informatics principles  

➡️ *Written analyses and policy-focused repositories*

---

### 🧠 Neuroscience Research & Education
I previously worked at a **neuroscience-focused nonprofit**, supporting research funding, education initiatives, and scientific advisory processes. This experience informs how I approach:
- Evidence-based health technology
- Clear communication of complex scientific ideas
- Responsible use of data in sensitive domains

---

## 🏋🏾‍♀️ Background in Group Fitness & Health Behavior
Before and alongside my technical work, I was a **group fitness instructor**, which strongly shapes my approach to digital health. It gave me hands-on experience with:
- Behavior change and motivation
- Wearable and fitness technologies in real-world settings
- Communicating data and goals to diverse populations

This perspective helps me design and evaluate health technologies that are **usable, engaging, and grounded in human behavior**.
